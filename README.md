# Quiz Time Homework!
## A simple Coding Trivia

This avtivity is a brain teaser, FOUR multiple choice questions that will put you to the test. Your goal is to complete all questions in the least amount of time as possible. Time is your enemy! For each question you get wrong, you will be panalized by 10 seconds. At the end, simply enter your initials and the remaining time on the timer will be your score.

This assignment brought lots of challenges, some that could not been met but overall I'm very please on the outcome. I spent a lot of time revising previous activities and resources trying to figure this thing out.
